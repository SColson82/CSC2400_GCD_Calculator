# Calculating Greatest Common Divisor

Using C++, this program explores various algorithms for calculating the Greatest Common Divisor of two integers.

## Part I:
The extended Euclidâ€™s algorithm determines not only the greatest common divisor, d, of two positive integers m and n, but also integers (not necessarily positive) x and y, such that: 


> ```mx + ny = d.```
 

## Part II: Consecutive Integer Checking Algorithm
The Consecutive Integer Checking Algorithm calculates the greatest common divisor by dividing both inputs from the user by every integer between one and the minimum of the two inputs. 

## Part III: Middle-school Implementation
The Middle School Method algorithm calculates the greatest common divisor by utilizing the method most students learned in middle school. Each input is factored and prime factors are placed in separate vectors each input. The two resulting vectors are compared, creating a third vector of the common elements of each of the input vectors. The product of the elements of the third vector is then calculated, resulting in the greatest common divisor for both input integers. 

## How to utilize this program.

- From CLI

> ```g++ -o gcd *.cpp```

- Input the executable name and two integers.

> ```./gcd.exe 254 32```

* Output - the result obtained using the three algorithms listed above.
* Displays - algorithm(m,n)=v where m and n are the inputs and v is the calculated gcd
  - Undefined - appears if no gcd exists.
