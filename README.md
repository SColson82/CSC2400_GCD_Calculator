# Calculating Greatest Common Divisor

Using C++, this program explores various algorithms for calculating the Greatest Common Divisor of two integers.

## Part I:
The extended Euclidâ€™s algorithm determines not only the greatest common divisor, d, of two positive integers m and n, but also integers (not necessarily positive) x and y, such that: 

<center>
mx + ny = d.
</center> 

## Part II: Consecutive Integer Checking Algorithm

## Part III: Middle-school Implementation

## How to utilize this program.

- From CLI

> <center>g++ -o gcd *.cpp</center>

- Input the executable name and two integers.

> <center>gcd.exe 254 32</center>

* Output - the result obtained using the three algorithms listed above.
* Displays - algorithm(m,n)=v where m and n are the inputs and v is the calculated gcd
  - Undefined - appears if no gcd exists.
